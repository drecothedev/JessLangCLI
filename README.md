Ciao!👋🏽 THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!!!

This is my first attempt at creating my own langauge. Recently i have started to fall in love with compilers, interpreters, parsers, etc. They are so interesting to work on because they feel like magic when they function correctly. Jess is a very premature language. It is not even partially functional yet, but it will be one day ( hopefully ). Thank you to Robert Nystrom for writing the crafting intepreters book as that has been my guide for creating this language. i welcome any feedback or tips from anyone.
